She&rsquo;s our first child so I know it&rsquo;ll significantly change our lives. Our lives have already been substantially changed by her - all of our time right now is focused on her. It&rsquo;s been amazing seeing her grow these past few weeks and also scary seeing how fast it&rsquo;s gone.</p><p>Since I know my life will be changed so much, my theme this year will be fatherhood. My primary concern for the beginning of this year, the rest of this year, and the rest of my life will be raising a healthy child so I think it&rsquo;s a fitting theme.</p><p>I have a lot of questions I want to answer related to having a child:</p><ul><li>Who will I be as a father?</li><li>How will I show up for my daughter?</li><li>What will my priorities be as a father?</li></ul><p>Hopefully I can answer them while going through this first year of parenthood.</p><p>The beginning of my 30s was defined by <a href=../reflecting-on-2021-year-of-quality>improving the quality of my life</a> and <a href=../yearly-theme-2022>building a foundation</a> on that quality. I want to keep that foundation because it&rsquo;s made me a stronger person. I work out regularly and have felt great physically. I continue to work on my mental health by managing my stress and improving how I handle difficult situations. I&rsquo;ve even started to go to therapy so I can continue to improve my mental health. My relationship with my wife and relationships with close friends are much stronger. And I&rsquo;ve grown a lot in my career too: I&rsquo;m a Staff / Senior Staff Software Engineer now and have moved to a new job at Bonusly.</p><p>However, a lot of my free time will be dedicated to raising a child so I may have to change how I approach some things in my life or dedicate less of my time towards some goals. So I want to ensure that I keep my strong foundation while flexing into my new responsibilities as a father.</p><p>So this year I also want to answer these questions about how my future will be shaped:</p><ul><li>Will my career priorities change now that I&rsquo;m a father?</li><li>What will my personal life and free time look like?</li><li>What will my relationships with others be like?</li><li>How will I maintain my physical and mental health?</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to being a father and learning and growing as a person because of it. I&rsquo;m expecting I&rsquo;ll transform a lot as a person this year. I&rsquo;ve already grown a lot in the beginning of this year and I&rsquo;m excited to see where I end up at the end of the year.</p><div class=footer>2018-2025 Jose Ibarra</div></div></body></html>
