  <h1>Yearly Theme 2022</h1>

<p>I was introduced to themes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE">this video.</a></p>

<p><a href="../reflecting-on-2021-year-of-quality">After reflecting on my theme from last year</a> and how I&rsquo;m feeling now, I realize that I mostly want to continue what I established last year. I want to build on the foundation that I lay and expand it to areas that I feel like I&rsquo;m missing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided my theme for 2022 is the year of foundation. I want to establish the foundation for who I am for the next few years.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-want-to-do">What do I want to do?</h2>

<p>I want to strengthen the foundation that I established last year. I plan to continue to maintain my physical health by regularly running and doing strength exercises. I also plan to keep my mental health strong - I&rsquo;ll maintain my work-life balance, quality activities during my time off, and less day-to-day stress. I&rsquo;ll continue to regularly use the Focus Modes on my Apple products too so that I can be less distracted. All of this means that I&rsquo;ll continue to work on the foundation to a life of quality.</p>

<p>I also want to build on that foundation and would like to work on some new focus areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Career: I&rsquo;ve been a software engineer for about 8 years and earned a promotion to Staff Software Engineer last year. I&rsquo;d like to figure out where I&rsquo;d like my career to go. Staff-plus engineers have a variety of archetypes and I&rsquo;d like to explore what I&rsquo;d like to do next.</li>
<li>Relationship: As of March of 2022, Krystal and I would have been in a relationship for 10 years. Last year I didn&rsquo;t make my relationship an explicit focus because I believed my focus on quality would help our relationship. This year I&rsquo;d like to focus on building our relationship foundation for the decades to come.</li>
<li>Life: I&rsquo;m 30 years old and I&rsquo;d like to figure out what kind of person I want to be for the next decade. My 20s was growing into an adult and growing as a person. I&rsquo;d like to continue to grow as a person. I think my career and relationship foundations will help guide this overall life foundation, too.</li>
<li>Posture: I think my posture could be improved so I&rsquo;d like to be more conscious of improving my posture everyday. That&rsquo;ll be important to enable me to continue my sedentary career for decades.</li>
<li>Mindfulness: Similarly, I&rsquo;d like to improve my mindfulness. I&rsquo;m unsure what that would look like (maybe regular meditation) but I think it&rsquo;ll help me improve my mental health.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to follow the same approach as I did last year to implement this theme. I&rsquo;ll journal daily about the theme, reflecting on my accomplishments from the day before and what I&rsquo;d like to do for the next day. I&rsquo;ll also regularly reflect on larger periods of time to see if I&rsquo;m directionally accurate for my 2022 theme.</p>
