  <h1>Improving My Communication</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Mon, May 25, 2020</span>
   
  <hr>
  
  <p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot to supplement my career development. I&rsquo;ve slowly come to the realization that the greatest thing I can do to further my career is by improving my communication:</p>

<ul>
<li>My thoughts will be more clear and concise. This will help build my arguments and improve my persuasive capabilities.</li>
<li>Discussions outside of engineering will be a lot easier. I&rsquo;ll be able to relay my ideas to non-engineers a lot better.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;ll increase my impact across my organization and company.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of those are important but to really level up as an engineer you have to expand your impact on the organization. Instead of being singularly focused (how can I push out features faster?), a senior engineer has a broader organizational focus (how can <em>we</em> push out features faster?). Writing is one of the best ways to have impact. It has a multiplying factor that can touch a broad set of people. It gives people an opportunity to read and respond in their own time, at their own pace. This is especially true with COVID-19 and work from home mandates.</p>

<p>Writing is also the best way to improve my communication. I&rsquo;ll improve on my persuasive style and build better, more concise arguments. It gives me time to form my thoughts and edit them into a better structure. I can also get feedback from others. The feedback could be explicit: &ldquo;Could you expand on this argument?&rdquo; It could also be implicit: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this portion.&rdquo; I can take that feedback and immediately improve the current document. It&rsquo;ll also build my understanding about writing and what works and doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>The best way to improve my writing (and thus my communication) is just by doing it. I&rsquo;ll get more practice and slowly get better at forming my thoughts. I&rsquo;ve made it a goal to write more going forward. This means at work I&rsquo;ll be writing more documents about my thoughts on our designs and our app. It also means at home I&rsquo;ll write more in this blog.</p>
