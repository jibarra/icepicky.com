We were having issues with the router randomly dropping internet connection and restarting itself.
The range was also bad for our home.
We had some issues setting up PPPoE on the new router because it wasn&rsquo;t obvious where to input the VLAN ID that we used for our old Netgear AC1750 router.

The table on that screen has an Internet row where you can input the VID, which I assume is an abbreviation for VLAN ID.
I also selected the Manual Setting for ISP profile.</p><p><img src=/static/img/setting-up-pppoe-at-home-for-asus-ac3200/vlan.jpg alt="VLAN ID configuration screenshot" class=img-responsive></p><p>Setting the PPPoE credentials was pretty straightforward.
I inputted this information in the WAN settings under the Internet Connection tab.
The WAN connection type was PPPoE and I inputted the username and password further down the page.</p><div class=footer>2018-2025 Jose Ibarra</div></div></body></html>
