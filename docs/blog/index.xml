      <description>Gusto hires really good people who are invested in seeing the company and coworkers succeed. The people kept me at Gusto for so long - everyone there was a pleasure to work with and everyone wanted you to be the best version of yourself.
In particular, I grew a lot from my relationships with:
Jeff was the most senior person on my first team at Gusto and I learned a ton from him.</description>

      <title>TIL: Git Force With Lease</title>

      <description>Today I learned about the Git --force-with-lease command.
I&amp;rsquo;ll restate a description of the command but it allows you to rebase and force push with less risks than using --force. If you had pushed your changes up to a remote branch and somebody else had pushed up new changes to that remote branch while you&amp;rsquo;re rebasing. After you finish rebasing, a normal git push will fail because the local refs don&amp;rsquo;t match the remote ones.</description>

      <title>TIL: SQL DISTINCT Efficiency</title>

      <description>Today I learned that DISTINCT statements can cause efficiency problems.
I was looking at some code that made a few joins across tables and used distinct for the column names. The query was causing high CPU load and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t immediately obvious from first glance why that was happening. You could imagine the query looked like this (with a few more joins and selects):
SELECT DISTINCT transactions.date, transactions.total_amount, transaction_items.amount, transaction_items.name FROM transactions INNER JOIN transaction_items ON transaction_items.</description>

      <title>TIL: MySQL Transaction Isolation Levels</title>

      <description>Today I learned about MySQL transaction isolation levels.
I was trying to debug issues where concurrent processes didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be locking rows in the database correctly. A simplified version of the offending code could look something like this (comments added for those unfamiliar with Rails):
# Reader: Assume the record we&amp;#39;re processing is not processed # Query for the row with ID 123 for table some_active_record_classes some_active_record_class = SomeActiveRecordClass.where(id: 123).</description>

      <title>Setting Up PPPoE at Home for Asus RT-AX88U</title>

      <description>Earlier this year, I got a new Asus RT-AX88U router for my home. We were having issues with the router randomly dropping internet connection and restarting itself. The range was also bad for our home.
We had some issues setting up PPPoE on the new router because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious where to input the VLAN ID that we used for our old Netgear AC1750 router.
Luckily, I found this blog post about configuring an ASUS RT-N66U that worked well for our RT-AX88U.</description>

      <description>Last year, we changed our internet service to a Gigabit line. The setup of Gigabit was pretty simple because our Internet Service Provider (CenturyLink) provided a free router. However, I wanted to use our router to ensure we had control over the hardware that performed our network and internet connections. In addition, the CenturyLink router underperformed our own router - the wifi range was too short to supply wifi to our entire home.</description>

      <description>I was introduced to themes from this video.
After reflecting on my theme from last year and how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling now, I realize that I mostly want to continue what I established last year. I want to build on the foundation that I lay and expand it to areas that I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m missing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided my theme for 2022 is the year of foundation. I want to establish the foundation for who I am for the next few years.</description>

      <description>My life at the start of 2021 2021 started as one of the most stressful periods of times for me as an adult. I typically keep my work life and personal life separated well but work stresses from the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 affected my mood and seeped into my personal life. I was the lead for a project that was estimated to take 3 months and we needed to deliver in 2.</description>

      <description>Warning: There will be major spoilers in this review, particularly about the beginning and end of the game.
I received The Last of Us Part 2 has a birthday present. I subsequently binge played the game in under 2 weeks, savoring every bit of it. The story of the game is very strong and it has good gameplay (mixed with some bad) to entertain in between the engrossing story bits.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot to supplement my career development. I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly come to the realization that the greatest thing I can do to further my career is by improving my communication:
My thoughts will be more clear and concise. This will help build my arguments and improve my persuasive capabilities. Discussions outside of engineering will be a lot easier. I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to relay my ideas to non-engineers a lot better.</description>

      <title>Tier Lists</title>

      <description>While at General Motors, I had a lot of opinionated discussions with friends. These conversations varied in topic and some of them involved ranking things in categories. After many of these discussions, I decided to create lists to rank the categories we discussed to compare with others. Unfortunately, I was the only one to create large and comrehensive tier lists.
This is a compilation of the tier lists I&amp;rsquo;ve created. I made 3 tier lists at GM (vegetables, fruits, desserts) and may add more tier lists in the future; I may also modify tier lists over time as I experience new items in a category or as my tastes change.</description>

      <description>The Creep movie series is a frightening exploration of a realistic situation with a mentally unstable person.
The realism of these movies is part of the reason they&amp;rsquo;re so scary. Instead of improbable situations or supernatural occurrences, everything is pretty much grounded in reality. The antagonist has mental health issues that drive him to be a serial killer and stalker. He acts just normal enough that you can believe his friendliness but he&amp;rsquo;s just weird enough to leave you unsettled.</description>
