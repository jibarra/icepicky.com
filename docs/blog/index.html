I wanted to give non-technical folks an understanding of why changes can take a long time to implement and why we sometimes need to do refactors. I iterated on it a bit to come to the correct metaphor, starting at the metaphor that our system is a &ldquo;tangled mess of spaghetti&rdquo; and ending at this version.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Feb. 1, 2025</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/reflecting-on-gusto-the-people/ title="Reflecting on Gusto - The People">Reflecting on Gusto - The People</a></h1>My thoughts on working at Gusto focused on the thing that is the best about working there: the people.

Every one of them was a pleasure to work with and everyone wanted you to be the best version of yourself.</p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Nov. 8, 2023</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/til-git-force-with-lease/ title="TIL: Git Force With Lease">TIL: Git Force With Lease</a></h1><p>Today I learned about <a href=https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt---force-with-leaseltrefnamegt target=_blank rel=noopener>the Git <code>--force-with-lease</code> command.</a></p><p>I&rsquo;ll restate a description of the command but it allows you to rebase and force push with less risks than using <code>--force</code>. If you had pushed your changes up to a remote branch and somebody else had pushed up new changes to that remote branch while you&rsquo;re rebasing. After you finish rebasing, a normal <code>git push</code> will fail because the local refs don&rsquo;t match the remote ones. Usually people will <code>git push --force</code> at this point because they were just rebasing their branch. However, this would wipe away commits on the remote branch. This is easy to do if you&rsquo;re working on a branch and don&rsquo;t realize that somebody else had commit to it.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Nov. 7, 2023</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/til-sql-distinct-efficiency/ title="TIL: SQL DISTINCT Efficiency">TIL: SQL DISTINCT Efficiency</a></h1><p>Today I learned that <code>DISTINCT</code> statements can cause efficiency problems.</p><p>I was looking at some code that made a few joins across tables and used distinct for the column names.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>From a high level, in order to execute this statement the database will filter for the rows that we need, grab the data we need from those rows, and return the unique ones. That seems simple enough for a database as long as the <code>date</code> column is indexed. However, the important part to consider is what the database needs to do to ensure all the data returned is unique. The database would need to keep all that data in memory someplace and use CPU time to sort these columns then remove the duplicates. Without the inclusion of a unique index, the sort will take time because there&rsquo;s no guarantee that each column is unique.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Aug. 21, 2023</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/til-mysql-transaction-isolation-levels/ title="TIL: MySQL Transaction Isolation Levels">TIL: MySQL Transaction Isolation Levels</a></h1><p>Today I learned about MySQL transaction isolation levels.</p><p>I was trying to debug issues where concurrent processes didn&rsquo;t seem to be locking rows in the database correctly.

The setup of Gigabit was pretty simple because our Internet Service Provider (CenturyLink) provided a free router. However, I wanted to use <em>our</em> router to ensure we had control over the hardware that performed our network and internet connections. In addition, the CenturyLink router underperformed our own router - the wifi range was too short to supply wifi to our entire home. So I did some investigating into how we could use our own router.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Jan. 23, 2022</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/yearly-theme-2022/ title="Yearly Theme 2022">Yearly Theme 2022</a></h1><p>I was introduced to themes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE" target=_blank rel=noopener>this video.</a></p><p><a href=../reflecting-on-2021-year-of-quality>After reflecting on my theme from last year</a> and how I&rsquo;m feeling now, I realize that I mostly want to continue what I established last year.

I was the lead for a project that was estimated to take 3 months and we needed to deliver in 2.5 months. To add, the project had an unmovable deadline due to hard-ish business constraints and hard government deadlines.

I&rsquo;ve slowly come to the realization that the greatest thing I can do to further my career is by improving my communication:</p><ul><li>My thoughts will be more clear and concise. This will help build my arguments and improve my persuasive capabilities.</li><li>Discussions outside of engineering will be a lot easier. I&rsquo;ll be able to relay my ideas to non-engineers a lot better.</li><li>It&rsquo;ll increase my impact across my organization and company.</li></ul><p>All of those are important but to really level up as an engineer you have to expand your impact on the organization. Instead of being singularly focused (how can I push out features faster?), a senior engineer has a broader organizational focus (how can <em>we</em> push out features faster?). Writing is one of the best ways to have impact. It has a multiplying factor that can touch a broad set of people. It gives people an opportunity to read and respond in their own time, at their own pace. This is especially true with COVID-19 and work from home mandates.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Dec. 12, 2018</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/tier-lists/ title="Tier Lists">Tier Lists</a></h1><p>While at General Motors, I had a lot of opinionated discussions with friends. These conversations varied in topic and some of them involved ranking things in categories. After many of these discussions, I decided to create lists to rank the categories we discussed to compare with others. Unfortunately, I was the only one to create large and comrehensive tier lists.</p><p>This is a compilation of the tier lists I&rsquo;ve created. I made 3 tier lists at GM (vegetables, fruits, desserts) and may add more tier lists in the future; I may also modify tier lists over time as I experience new items in a category or as my tastes change. I follow a scheme like fighting game tier lists: S > A > B > C > D. I also try to maintain ordering within a tier so the top item in the S tier is the best for the entire category. I&rsquo;ll try to explain my reasoning for ratings and describe my criteria for rating each tier list. The criteria is an attempt to make my opinions at least partially objective. Tiers are definitely skewed by what I&rsquo;ve been able to experience and have some natural inherent bias. In addition, I try to keep items general (like cake or pies) but if a specific item stands out of the general groupmfor positive or negative aspects, I&rsquo;ll pull it out and rank it separately (like carrot cake).</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Oct. 25, 2018</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/creep-review/ title="Creep Review">Creep Review</a></h1><p>The Creep movie series is a frightening exploration of a realistic situation with a mentally unstable person.</p><p>The realism of these movies is part of the reason they&rsquo;re so scary. Instead of improbable situations or supernatural occurrences, everything is pretty much grounded in reality. The antagonist has mental health issues that drive him to be a serial killer and stalker. He acts just normal enough that you can believe his friendliness but he&rsquo;s just weird enough to leave you unsettled. The antagonist&rsquo;s weirdness is even explained in the first movie so his actions are all believable in the beginning. The protagonists give the serial killer multiple chances to explain himself but these chances don&rsquo;t feel forced just to extend the movie. The endings of the movies just solidify the eeriness of the killer.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Feb. 3, 2018</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/test/ title="This is my first post">This is my first post</a></h1>This is just a test blog post so there&rsquo;s not much to summarize.</p></div></div><div class=footer>2018-2025 Jose Ibarra</div></div></body></html>
