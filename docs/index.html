She&rsquo;s our first child so I know it&rsquo;ll significantly change our lives. Our lives have already been substantially changed by her - all of our time right now is focused on her. It&rsquo;s been amazing seeing her grow these past few weeks and also scary seeing how fast it&rsquo;s gone.</p><p>Since I know my life will be changed so much, my theme this year will be fatherhood. My primary concern for the beginning of this year, the rest of this year, and the rest of my life will be raising a healthy child so I think it&rsquo;s a fitting theme.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Aug 21, 2025</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/a-metaphor-for-refactors/ title="A Metaphor for Refactors">A Metaphor for Refactors</a></h1><p>I wrote this piece as a part of a weekly project update email at Bonusly. I wanted to give non-technical folks an understanding of why changes can take a long time to implement and why we sometimes need to do refactors. I iterated on it a bit to come to the correct metaphor, starting at the metaphor that our system is a &ldquo;tangled mess of spaghetti&rdquo; and ending at this version.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Feb 1, 2025</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/reflecting-on-gusto-the-people/ title="Reflecting on Gusto - The People">Reflecting on Gusto - The People</a></h1>My thoughts on working at Gusto focused on the thing that is the best about working there: the people. I learned a lot from every one there and really appreciated the support and guidance they provided. Every one of them was a pleasure to work with and everyone wanted you to be the best version of yourself.</p></div></div><div class=footer>2018-2026 Jose Ibarra</div></div></body></html>
