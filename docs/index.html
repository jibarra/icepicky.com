I wanted to give non-technical folks an understanding of why changes can take a long time to implement and why we sometimes need to do refactors. I iterated on it a bit to come to the correct metaphor, starting at the metaphor that our system is a &ldquo;tangled mess of spaghetti&rdquo; and ending at this version.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Feb 1, 2025</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/reflecting-on-gusto-the-people/ title="Reflecting on Gusto - The People">Reflecting on Gusto - The People</a></h1>My thoughts on working at Gusto focused on the thing that is the best about working there: the people. I learned a lot from every one there and really appreciated the support and guidance they provided. Every one of them was a pleasure to work with and everyone wanted you to be the best version of yourself.</p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Nov 8, 2023</div><h1><a href=//www.icepicky.com/blog/til-git-force-with-lease/ title="TIL: Git Force With Lease">TIL: Git Force With Lease</a></h1><p>Today I learned about <a href=https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt---force-with-leaseltrefnamegt target=_blank rel=noopener>the Git <code>--force-with-lease</code> command</a> .</p><p>I&rsquo;ll restate a description of the command but it allows you to rebase and force push with less risks than using <code>--force</code>. If you had pushed your changes up to a remote branch and somebody else had pushed up new changes to that remote branch while you&rsquo;re rebasing. After you finish rebasing, a normal <code>git push</code> will fail because the local refs don&rsquo;t match the remote ones. Usually people will <code>git push --force</code> at this point because they were just rebasing their branch. However, this would wipe away commits on the remote branch. This is easy to do if you&rsquo;re working on a branch and don&rsquo;t realize that somebody else had commit to it.</p></p></div></div><div class=footer>2018-2025 Jose Ibarra</div></div></body></html>
