      <description>Last year, we changed our internet service to a Gigabit line. The setup of Gigabit was pretty simple because our Internet Service Provider (CenturyLink) provided a free router. However, I wanted to use our router to ensure we had control over the hardware that performed our network and internet connections. In addition, the CenturyLink router underperformed our own router - the wifi range was too short to supply wifi to our entire home.</description>

      <description>I was introduced to themes from this video.
After reflecting on my theme from last year and how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling now, I realize that I mostly want to continue what I established last year. I want to build on the foundation that I lay and expand it to areas that I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m missing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided my theme for 2022 is the year of foundation. I want to establish the foundation for who I am for the next few years.</description>

      <description>My life at the start of 2021 2021 started as one of the most stressful periods of times for me as an adult. I typically keep my work life and personal life separated well but work stresses from the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 affected my mood and seeped into my personal life. I was the lead for a project that was estimated to take 3 months and we needed to deliver in 2.</description>

      <description>Warning: There will be major spoilers in this review, particularly about the beginning and end of the game.
 I received The Last of Us Part 2 has a birthday present. I subsequently binge played the game in under 2 weeks, savoring every bit of it. The story of the game is very strong and it has good gameplay (mixed with some bad) to entertain in between the engrossing story bits.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot to supplement my career development. I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly come to the realization that the greatest thing I can do to further my career is by improving my communication:
 My thoughts will be more clear and concise. This will help build my arguments and improve my persuasive capabilities. Discussions outside of engineering will be a lot easier. I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to relay my ideas to non-engineers a lot better.</description>

      <title>Tier Lists</title>

      <description>While at General Motors, I had a lot of opinionated discussions with friends. These conversations varied in topic and some of them involved ranking things in categories. After many of these discussions, I decided to create lists to rank the categories we discussed to compare with others. Unfortunately, I was the only one to create large and comrehensive tier lists.
This is a compilation of the tier lists I&amp;rsquo;ve created. I made 3 tier lists at GM (vegetables, fruits, desserts) and may add more tier lists in the future; I may also modify tier lists over time as I experience new items in a category or as my tastes change.</description>

      <description>The Creep movie series is a frightening exploration of a realistic situation with a mentally unstable person.
The realism of these movies is part of the reason they&amp;rsquo;re so scary. Instead of improbable situations or supernatural occurrences, everything is pretty much grounded in reality. The antagonist has mental health issues that drive him to be a serial killer and stalker. He acts just normal enough that you can believe his friendliness but he&amp;rsquo;s just weird enough to leave you unsettled.</description>

      <description>This application was created for the 2017 General Motors (GM) Arizona Hackathon. It integrated with existing GM services to locate resources (people, rooms, printers, bathrooms) in an augmented reality (AR) Android application.
The application utilizes a custom AR framework to display the resources on the screen. The application utilized multiple Android services like the location, compass, gyroscope, accelerometer &amp;amp; camera to position AR objects on the screen. A resource&amp;rsquo;s location was determined by comparing the user&amp;rsquo;s current location, height &amp;amp; compass position and the target resource&amp;rsquo;s location &amp;amp; height; the framework also weighted AR object size by distance from the user.</description>

      <description>This application was created for the 2016 General Motors National Hackathon Championships. It integrates the user&amp;rsquo;s life with autonomous vehicle services.
The application utilizes calendars provided by the user to schedule events for your autonomous car to use. The application can automatically suggest events by querying the OnStar API for things like oil levels. Calendar events and destinations display on the Android app so the user is aware of their car&amp;rsquo;s location.</description>
