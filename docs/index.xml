      <description>This application was created for the 2016 General Motors National Hackathon Championships. It integrates the user&amp;rsquo;s life with autonomous vehicle services.
The application utilizes calendars provided by the user to schedule events for your autonomous car to use. The application can automatically suggest events by querying the OnStar API for things like oil levels. Calendar events and destinations display on the Android app so the user is aware of their car&amp;rsquo;s location.</description>
