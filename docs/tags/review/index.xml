&lt;p>I received The Last of Us Part 2 has a birthday present. I subsequently binge played the game in under 2 weeks, savoring every bit of it. The story of the game is very strong and it has good gameplay (mixed with some bad) to entertain in between the engrossing story bits.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creep Review</title><link>//www.icepicky.com/blog/creep-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2018 19:28:23 -0700</pubDate><guid>//www.icepicky.com/blog/creep-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Creep movie series is a frightening exploration of a realistic situation with a mentally unstable person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The realism of these movies is part of the reason they&amp;rsquo;re so scary. Instead of improbable situations or supernatural occurrences, everything is pretty much grounded in reality. The antagonist has mental health issues that drive him to be a serial killer and stalker. He acts just normal enough that you can believe his friendliness but he&amp;rsquo;s just weird enough to leave you unsettled. The antagonist&amp;rsquo;s weirdness is even explained in the first movie so his actions are all believable in the beginning. The protagonists give the serial killer multiple chances to explain himself but these chances don&amp;rsquo;t feel forced just to extend the movie. The endings of the movies just solidify the eeriness of the killer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
