      <description>Today I learned that DISTINCT statements can cause efficiency problems.
I was looking at some code that made a few joins across tables and used distinct for the column names. The query was causing high CPU load and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t immediately obvious from first glance why that was happening. You could imagine the query looked like this (with a few more joins and selects):
SELECT DISTINCT transactions.date, transactions.total_amount, transaction_items.amount, transaction_items.name FROM transactions INNER JOIN transaction_items ON transaction_items.</description>

      <description>Today I learned about MySQL transaction isolation levels.
I was trying to debug issues where concurrent processes didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be locking rows in the database correctly. A simplified version of the offending code could look something like this (comments added for those unfamiliar with Rails):
# Reader: Assume the record we&amp;#39;re processing is not processed # Query for the row with ID 123 for table some_active_record_classes some_active_record_class = SomeActiveRecordClass.where(id: 123).</description>
