&lt;p>The realism of these movies is part of the reason they&amp;rsquo;re so scary. Instead of improbable situations or supernatural occurrences, everything is pretty much grounded in reality. The antagonist has mental health issues that drive him to be a serial killer and stalker. He acts just normal enough that you can believe his friendliness but he&amp;rsquo;s just weird enough to leave you unsettled. The antagonist&amp;rsquo;s weirdness is even explained in the first movie so his actions are all believable in the beginning. The protagonists give the serial killer multiple chances to explain himself but these chances don&amp;rsquo;t feel forced just to extend the movie. The endings of the movies just solidify the eeriness of the killer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
