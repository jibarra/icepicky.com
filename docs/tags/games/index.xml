      <description>Warning: There will be major spoilers in this review, particularly about the beginning and end of the game.
I received The Last of Us Part 2 has a birthday present. I subsequently binge played the game in under 2 weeks, savoring every bit of it. The story of the game is very strong and it has good gameplay (mixed with some bad) to entertain in between the engrossing story bits.</description>
