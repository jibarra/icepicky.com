      <description>This application was created for the 2017 General Motors (GM) Arizona Hackathon. It integrated with existing GM services to locate resources (people, rooms, printers, bathrooms) in an augmented reality (AR) Android application.
The application utilizes a custom AR framework to display the resources on the screen. The application utilized multiple Android services like the location, compass, gyroscope, accelerometer &amp;amp; camera to position AR objects on the screen. A resource&amp;rsquo;s location was determined by comparing the user&amp;rsquo;s current location, height &amp;amp; compass position and the target resource&amp;rsquo;s location &amp;amp; height; the framework also weighted AR object size by distance from the user.</description>

      <description>This application was created for the 2016 General Motors National Hackathon Championships. It integrates the user&amp;rsquo;s life with autonomous vehicle services.
The application utilizes calendars provided by the user to schedule events for your autonomous car to use. The application can automatically suggest events by querying the OnStar API for things like oil levels. Calendar events and destinations display on the Android app so the user is aware of their car&amp;rsquo;s location.</description>
