## Project & Development Experience

### House Repository for Every Part (HREP) – General Motors: Internal Project

General Motors: *Internal Project, May 2017 - Present*

* Rewrite of existing Access application in the Spring MVC framework and a custom jQuery
framework.
* Created and maintained CI/CD system which greatly reduced deployment and defect detection times; combined Gradle, Jenkins, CA Release Automation, Junit, and Selenium.
* Designed Selenium framework to improve test creation for Kendo Grid pages which reduced test creation time from several days to just one day.

### Material Global Optimization (MGO)

General Motors: *Internal Project, June 2015 - Present*

* Monolithic, 24/7 supply chain system that manages the planning, ordering, and scheduling for
parts and shipping in manufacturing plants, managing billions of dollars of supply.
* Developed backend modules to do a majority of business logic; used frontend (JSP, JS, jQuery),
backend (Java), mainframe technologies (PL/I and COBOL).
* Improved mainframe unit testing framework utilizing Junit which shifted unit testing from mostly
manual to mostly automated, significantly reducing retest time.
* Led proof of concept for upgrading Struts 1 to Struts 2 and improved existing estimates by 35%.
* Technical leader for a Struts 1 to SpringMVC conversion project.
* Improved existing and created new Struts 1 conversion tools to lower file conversion time by 20%.
* Developed a proof of concept mobile application utilizing Angular.js which was expected to
improve plant worker productivity through a simple UI.
* Trained 20 new hires in Java and SpringMVC skill to onboard them quickly for a Struts 1 to
SpringMVC conversion project.

### Geo-Genealogy and Geo-Demographics Data Visualization Research

VADER Research Lab: *https://doi.org/10.2312/eurova.20141143, https://demo.vaderlab.org/name/, August 2013 - May 2014*

* Application displayed a heatmap of surname density for the United States and the income distribution for that surname in a web application utilizing JS, jQuery, D3.js and Java web services.
* Mined over 60 million data records from US phonebooks and correlated to zip code-based US Census records; stored data and mining results in MySQL and MongoDB.
* Preprocessed surname maps and income distributions that reduced server processing and improved response times from several minutes to several seconds.
* Developed multi-threaded data preprocessing methods which processed surname data independently and improved processing capability by factor of 5.

### SNL Conference Room Scheduler

Sandia National Labs: *Internal Project, May 2013 - May 2014*

* Modernized webpage based scheduling application by designing a map-based, visual iOS app that
reduced conference room scheduling time by 10-20%; integrated ArcGIS, Objective-C, Java.
* ConstructedJavawebservicestoquerySQLserversforneededdata.
* Designed user interface using Apple’s UI Framework and the ArcGIS framework.
