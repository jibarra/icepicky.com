This website was created for [INSPIR3 - Mental Wellness Center](https://www.inspir3.com) in the summer of 2016. The website is a basic static website that describes the vision and goals of INSPIR3 and promotes their capital campaign.

The website utilizes the [Foundation framework from ZURB](https://foundation.zurb.com) for the design of the website. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is the HTTP server for the website and the blogging platform used for the website. The HTTP server utilized Express.js and the Pug view engine to serve dynamic webpages. Pug allowed easy changes for duplicated content such as the navbar and footer.

I designed and developed the entire website. I completed the following tasks:

* Integrating a variety of frameworks and libraries: [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](http://expressjs.com), [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html), and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/developers/).
* Collaborating and communicating with customer's to develop the website according to requirements. This includes modifying the website based on the customer's feedback during meetings.
* Converting from static HTML to Pug templates to enable quick changes to duplicated parts of the website, like the navbar and footer.
* Building a contact form to email the founders from the Node.js backend when a vistor submits an inquiry.
* Matching design and logos throughout website and social networking.
* Integration with [Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com) to enable donations.
